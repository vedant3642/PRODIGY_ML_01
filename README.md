A machine learning project that predicts house prices using Linear Regression, developed as Task 1 for the Prodigy Infotech Machine Learning Internship.

## üìå Overview

This project implements a robust Linear Regression model to estimate house prices based on key features:
- Square footage
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms

The solution includes complete data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization components.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Comprehensive Data Analysis**: Exploratory data analysis to understand feature distributions and relationships
- **Model Evaluation**: Multiple metrics including L1Loss (MAE)
- **Visualizations**: Clear plots showing actual vs predicted values and feature importance
- **Modular Code**: Well-structured Python scripts for easy maintenance and extension
- **Training Loops**: Training Loops to train model upto 1000 epochs
